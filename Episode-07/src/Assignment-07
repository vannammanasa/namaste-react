5. Client side routing v Server Side routing?
- The routing mechanism can be implemented on either the client or server side. In general, all frameworks (front-end and back-end) implement routing internally and execute different functionalities based on URL changes or user requests.


  a-The Server side routing is not a part of React router but still the most common form of handling routes.
  --Ex:- When a user clicks on a link on a webpage, another whole page is loaded and rendered onto the screen. The URL path is updated to match where the user is in the current state of the web page.
  -This “whole page” that is loaded and rendered is done through the server. Server-side routing is what causes the whole page to refresh because we are making another request to our server, which is providing us with a brand new page to display.

  The main drawback to using server-side routing is the varied time it can take content to display on a page. If the page, the user is requesting will still have that header and footer information displayed onto the screen, then why would we need to reload this information?
