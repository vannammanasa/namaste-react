/* 1. Difference b/w named export,default export and * export?
 -These are fundamental concepts that enable the modular structure of react applications.
 - In JS, modules are individual files that contain code and this code can be objects,functions,classes or react components.
 Export:-
  --This export keyword allows all the elements to be used in JS files,thus making code reusable and modular.
  --This export is of 2 types,Default export(This can be used when a file exports only 1-component).
  Ex:- export default resList
       import resList from "../utils/mockdata"

  --Named export(These are used when a file exports multiple components or values).
  Ex:-export const CDN_URL="";
      import {CDN_URL} from "../utils/constants";


  --Alternatively, we can use the * symbol to import all the named exports from a file as an object, which is very similar to other languages like python and java.
  Ex:- import * as utils from '../utils'; 

      



2.Importance of config.js file
--In this file, Hard coded data(such as urls,strings) will be put .Also known as "utils.js"
ex:-config.js or utils.js

3. React Hooks
--Hooks let us use different React features from your components.React Hook is a normal JS utility function 


4. Usestate():-
  --It generates superpowerful state variable in react.
  --As soon as state variable updates,react will re-render our component.
  

  Ex: import {usestate} from 'react';
